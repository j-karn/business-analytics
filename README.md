# business-analytics

Final project from the Business Analytics with SQL and Python course offered by RMIT Online

The course covers data modelling, forecasting using intro SQL and Python and is built with Australian partners using real-world data sets. At the end of this course, the students are expected to create a project; to build and apply a simple data analytics model to answer a business problem.

The final project involves reporting the findings to the SuperFoodsMax decision-makers. Part of the analysis will include a report of your interpretation of what the data has revealed. You will be called upon to formally present those findings to the decision-makers who commissioned the data analysis project. In this report, you will develop a range of visual interpretations, along with your insights into what the data reveals.

<b>Libraries</b> - pandas, numpy, statsmodel, plotly, matplotlib, seaborn
